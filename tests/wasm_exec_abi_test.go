// wasmExecWorker is goflare's vendored copy of TinyGo's wasm_exec.js. It is

// TestWasmExec_TicksUsesInt64ABI is the regression test for the crash that made
// veltylabs/iam unreachable in production. The symptom reported by Cloudflare was
// only "the Workers runtime canceled this request because it detected that your
// Worker's code had hung"; the actual failure, recovered by running the same
// artifacts under workerd, was:
//
//	TypeError: Cannot convert 1787642221321 to a BigInt
//
// That number is `timeOrigin + performance.now()` — a millisecond timestamp.
// TinyGo declares the runtime.ticks import as returning **i64 nanoseconds**, so
// the JS side must return a BigInt. The vendored copy had been taken from an
// older TinyGo where ticks was `float64` milliseconds, and returning a plain
// Number traps the module the first time the runtime reads the clock.
//
// The trap fires during package initialization, before main() runs, so the Worker
// prints nothing at all — which is exactly why it presented as an unexplained
// hang. Any Worker touching time even transitively (unixid, jwt, a time.Now() in
// an init) is affected; a Worker that never reads the clock is not, which is why
// the failure looked app-specific rather than like the ABI mismatch it was.
